<h2>1. Introduction to Bridge Base — what “Bridge Base” refers to</h2>
<p><strong>Bridge Base</strong> refers to Bridge Base Online (commonly called <strong>BBO</strong>), a widely used platform to <strong>play bridge online</strong>, enter <strong>bridge tournaments online</strong>, take lessons, and store <strong>hand records (PBN)</strong> for analysis. It serves everyone from brand-new learners to tournament directors and club organizers.</p>

<h3>Club players</h3>
<p>Bridge clubs use the platform to run online duplicate games and create private clubs and team matches.</p>

<h3>Tournament players and directors</h3>
<p>Supports scheduled tournaments, masterpoint reporting (ACBL context), and exportable hand records for scorers.</p>

<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>Teachers and tutors can run private tables, set up teaching hands, and use kibitzing for live instruction.</p>

<h2>4. How Bridge Base works (quick architecture)</h2>
<p>The platform runs a server-backed web client, native mobile apps, and a downloadable desktop client. Accounts are stored server-side with privacy settings and optional profile linking for national IDs. The system supports real-time play, asynchronous result posting, and <strong>deal replay/analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>For deeper technical or bridge-bridge topics such as network bridges and interoperability, consult the project documentation: <a href="https://docs.base.org/base-chain/network-information/bridges">Bridge Base Docs</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Getting started step-by-step</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a free account with a valid email and choose a username.</li>
  <li>Set up your profile: country (U.S.), ACBL number if you want masterpoints added, and privacy preferences.</li>
  <li>Decide client: play in a browser (web client) or download the desktop app for multi-table use. Mobile players can install the mobile bridge app from their store.</li>
  <li>Link ACBL/ID if you intend to earn ACBL masterpoints — follow platform prompts in account settings (verify with ACBL if needed).</li>
  <li>Run a quick practice hand with robots to test audio and connectivity.</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. Playing on Bridge Base</h2>
<h3>Joining a table</h3>
<p>You can <strong>sit-and-play</strong> at public tables, join friends by name, or accept invites to private games. Choose casual/unrated for practice or rated games for official standings.</p>

<h3>Casual vs rated games</h3>
<p>Rated games contribute to leaderboards and masterpoints (when affiliated). Casual games are unscored and ideal for experimenting with bidding conventions.</p>

<h3>Private tables and playing with friends</h3>
<p>Create private tables and set passwords or invite links. Use the platform’s private club features to run recurring club sessions.</p>

<h2>7. Tournaments and scheduled games</h2>
<p>Tournaments follow formats such as duplicate matchpoints, team-of-four, and Swiss. Use the schedule or calendar to find events and register.</p>

<h3>How to join a tournament — step-by-step checklist</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Tournaments tab and filter by date/time and region (U.S. or global).</li>
  <li>Verify event type (duplicate, teams, pairs) and stratification.</li>
  <li>Register early — some events require pre-registration or payment for masterpoint credit.</li>
  <li>If required, link your ACBL number and confirm it appears on the registration screen.</li>
  <li>At start time, arrive in the tournament lobby; the director will seat you or automatically seat registered pairs.</li>
  <li>After play, download your results and export the hand records for review.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Time controls:</strong> Standard tournament clocks and per-board limits apply; check the event description for speed (e.g., 10s/board, 12 board sessions).</p>

<h2>8. Robots, bots and AI play</h2>
<p>Robots are useful for practice and for filling seats in private games. They follow programmed bidding conventions and play logic — excellent for drilling hands but limited for nuanced human psychology. Use robots to test new bidding conventions before using them in rated play.</p>

<h2>9. Bidding, scoring and conventions</h2>
<p>Bridge Base supports a wide array of <strong>bidding conventions</strong>. At the table, set your convention card and agree conventions with your partner. The platform enforces alerting rules and displays convention notes where required.</p>

<p><strong>Scoring variants:</strong> Duplicate (matchpoints, IMPs) is the most common online; rubber and Chicago-style scoring may be available in casual play.</p>

<h2>10. Masterpoints, rankings and records</h2>
<p>In the U.S., ACBL masterpoints are awarded according to the event's sanctioning and stratification. Bridge Base reports results to the national organization when the event is sanctioned. Read the event description to confirm masterpoint eligibility.</p>

<h3>Reading results and exporting</h3>
<p>After a tournament, view the results page for standings and masterpoint awards. Export hand records in PBN (Portable Bridge Notation) or RECs for archiving and analysis.</p>

<h2>11. Analysis and study tools</h2>
<p>Use the deal replay/analysis mode to step through bidding and play, view alternate lines, and compare declarer play. Save hands to folders and export PBN files for use in offline analyzers or for sharing with a teacher.</p>

<table>
  <caption>Example PBN / hand-export workflow</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Step</th><th>Action</th><th>File Type</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>Open results for board(s)</td><td>—</td><td>Locate export or "Download hands" button</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td>Export selected boards</td><td>PBN</td><td>PBN contains full deal and auction/play record</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td><td>Save to disk</td><td>.pbn</td><td>Use for post-mortem analysis or import into practice tools</td></tr>
    <tr><td>4</td><td>Open in analyzer</td><td>—</td><td>Review lines, use double-dummy or coach features</td></tr>

<h2>14. Security, etiquette and fair play</h2>
<p>Keep your account secure with a strong password and two-factor authentication (if offered). Respect kibitzing etiquette: use the kibitz view for observed hands and avoid discussing ongoing boards unless permitted. Report suspicious behavior quickly; platforms have strict cheating policies and will investigate.</p>

<h2>15. Troubleshooting and common issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connection drops:</strong> Use wired Ethernet for desktop or a strong Wi‑Fi signal on mobile. Close bandwidth-heavy apps when playing.</li>
  <li><strong>Lag or late alerts:</strong> Reduce graphical settings, use the desktop client if available for better stability.</li>
  <li><strong>Browser problems:</strong> Clear cache, try an alternative modern browser, and ensure pop-ups are allowed for new windows.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile app crashes:</strong> Update to the latest app version; reinstall if persistent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>16. Advanced workflows and tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use the desktop client for multi-table tournaments and to run multiple windows for scores and analysis.</li>
  <li>Set up private clubs for recurring members to control access and levy game fees.</li>
  <li>Export hands (.pbn) after events and keep a study folder organized by date and theme (e.g., slam bidding).</li>
</ul>

<h2>17. Alternatives and complementary ways to play</h2>
<p>Complement your online play with local clubs, in-person tournaments, and study groups. Live play teaches tempo, partnership psychology, and physical tell-reading that online platforms do not provide.</p>
